# Next Loader

**Next Loader** â€“ Next Loader is a next generation EFI-Based Boot Manager based on rEFInd tailored
and designed for Intel Macs in mind, meaning that it presents a menu of options to the user when
the computer first starts up, as shown in the image above.

Next Loader as well as rEFInd allow you to dynamically load EFI drivers, create boot stanzas with
custom arguments, and be highly customizable thanks to its built-in theme engine.

Next Loader was created to give Mac users more flexibility and options, allowing them to do dual-booting
or even triple-booting on their Mac without the need of hacks or tools.

## Features
### Built-in NVMe Driver
The NvmExpressDxe driver comes built-in and preloaded into Next Loader, allowing you to install any OS
and boot from NVMe on unsupported machines.

### UEFI GOP Compliant
Next Loader is compliant with the GOP standard of the UEFI implementation, allowing you to initialize 
any modern graphics card with GOP support, even working with HiDPi resolutions.

### Windows Without Boot Camp
Installs Windows (UEFI-Compatible only) without the need for Boot Camp or an optical drive (in the case
of Macs with optical drives), now you can install Windows in UEFI mode from a bootable USB drive.
You can install Windows in UEFI mode even on machines that do not support Boot Camp, such as Xserve.

### Multiple Booting Support
Mac do not support the installation of Linux or any other non-Windows operating system officially, the
only way was to use Boot Camp. Now you can not only install Windows, but also any Linux distribution and
have multiple booting options.
